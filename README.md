## Acceptance Criteria

#### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

- Your name :heavy_check_mark:

- Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number :heavy_check_mark:

- A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects :heavy_check_mark:

- A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  - Project title :heavy_check_mark:

  - Link to the deployed version :heavy_check_mark:

  - Link to the GitHub repository :heavy_check_mark:

  - GIF or screenshot of the deployed application :heavy_check_mark:

#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design :heavy_check_mark:

- Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. :heavy_check_mark:

- Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain. :heavy_check_mark:

- If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note
  that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge. :heavy_check_mark:

#### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React. :heavy_check_mark:

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

- A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages :heavy_check_mark:

- A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page :heavy_check_mark:

- Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router :heavy_check_mark:

- A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages :heavy_check_mark:

#### Updated LinkedIn Profile

Make sure to update your LinkedIn Profile with the new skills you've acquired since the last time it was updated.:heavy_check_mark:
